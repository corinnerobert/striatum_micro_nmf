# HCP data sharing checklist
 1. ## Summary
    1. ### Open-access data use terms

        To use and redistribute HCP data or derivatives HCP data you must share it under the same [open-access data use terms](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/wu-minn-hcp-consortium-open-access-data-use-terms) provided by the HCP. You must not try to contact or identify human subjects and you must comply with your institution guidelines as the HCP data is not de-identified.
    1. ### Restricted data use terms 

         Additionnally with the open-access data use terms, to share HCP data derivatives that uses restricted data you must comply with the [restricted data use terms](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/wu-minn-hcp-consortium-restricted-data-use-terms) provided by the HCP. Briefly, **except for family structure**, you cannot publicly share any subject-specific information that is part of the restricted data (handedness, subject's age within a 5 year ranges, birth order, ethnicity/race, body weight, height, BMI, color vision, visual correction measures, SSAGA telephone diagnostic info, drug test results, HbA1c and TSH results, endocrine disorders info, any psychiatric and neurologic illnesses of subjects' parents). **IF** you want to share subject-specific family structure information or derivatives that used restricted data, you must not share HCP subject's specific IDs. Instead, you need to make study-specifc ones of your choosing (like A,B,C...) that you can link to the HCP IDs using the a [Subject key](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/creating-and-using-subject-keys-connectomedb). **Your Subject key will be made available to the HCP restricted data user only, you cannot share this key publicly**.

         Here are some example of what is ok and not ok to share: you can publicly share the mean age of your overall sample BUT you cannot share the exact age of subject A; you can share the family structure of subject A BUT you cannot share any other restricted info about subject A; you cannot share the family structure of subject (HCP specific ID)
    1. ### Acknowledgement and License

        As you must know, any data used in your research that was not acquired by yourself or your coauthors needs to be acknowledge properly in the acknowledgment section, otherwise it constitutes a form of plagiarism. Hence, if you are using HCP data, in your acknowledgment section you need to write the following : "Data were provided [in part] by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University.".

1. ## Checklist
    1. ### If your derivatives only used restricted HCP data
    [comment]: <> (can you share everythin directly? or still need to make study-specific IDs?)
    1.  ### If your derivatives used restricted HCP data
        1. For subject specific data/derivatives (**[open-access data](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/quick-reference-open-access-vs-restricted-data) or family-structure only**): 
            - [ ] Make study specific IDs
            - [ ] Link your study-specific IDs to the HCP IDs with a [Subject key](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/creating-and-using-subject-keys-connectomedb)
            - [ ] Share subject specific data with study-specific IDs 
        1. For multiple-subject derivatives:
            1. If data analyzed with [Additional Restricted Data elements](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/wu-minn-hcp-consortium-restricted-data-use-terms)
                 - [ ] Check if derivatives contain at least 3 subjects
                 - [ ] Remove study-specific IDs link to individual data points
                 - [ ] Share derivatives
            1. Id data anlyzed only contain open-access data (e.g images ...):
                - [ ] Share derivates, you may link individual datapoints to study-specific IDs
